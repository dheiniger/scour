Scour

A very small Clojure library intended for crawling and downloading webpages.

## Usage

Require the code namespace:
```clojure
(ns example
  (:require [scour.core :as scour]))
```

Provide a URL and scan all the resources on the domain

```clojure
(def results (scour/scan "https://example.com/"))
(count results) 
=> 1
```

Provide optional filters to include resources that are outside of the domain.
```clojure
(defn example-filter [s]
  (str/ends-with? s "/example"))

(def results (scour/scan "https://example.com/" {:inc-filters [example-filter]}))

(map first results)
=> ("https://example.com" "https://www.iana.org/domains/example")

```
